It's the way we embrace the living/learning model for residential life and implement innovative ideas like the POWER Series where residents can decompress with free massages, or NH101, a program designed to have our upperclassmen help first year students better navigate the Institute. And we are just far enough away from the classrooms and laboratories to make you feel as if you have truly \"come home\" at the end of the day.

We encourage you to explore all of our many cultures. Venture out of your comfort zones and learn more about the many beliefs and values of your fellow residents.
